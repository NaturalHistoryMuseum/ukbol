      <h1>DNA Barcoding</h1>
      DNA barcoding uses a short, standardized segment of an organismâ€™s genome
      for identification. Much like a fingerprint which is unique to an
      individual, selected fragment(s) of DNA are unique to each species but
      require comparison to reference libraries for identification. The
      reference libraries are built by sequencing these DNA fragments from
      expertly identified specimens, vouchered in public collections.

      <h2>Target Genes</h2>
      Several genes are targeted for DNA barcoding, depending on the group:
      Animal studies primarily use a region in the mitochondrial cytochrome c
      oxidase 1 gene (aka. CO1, COX1, COI), though other genes such as 12S are
      now routinely used for vertebrates. Plant studies typically use one or a
      few plastid regions (e.g. rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA) and the internal
      transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Fungal studies
      use the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA.
