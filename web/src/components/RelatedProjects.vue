        <a href="https://www.ibol.org/">International Barcode of Life (iBOL)</a>
      </h3>

      The International Barcode of Life Consortium (iBOL) launched in 2008 and
      has since grown to be the largest DNA barcode sequencing consortium in the
      world. iBoL leads a network of national hubs, across over 30 countries and
      more than 1,000 researchers, to help progress the goal to barcode sequence
      all life to create a robust framework for biodiversity surveillance. iBoL
      has successfully delivered on its first phase “Barcode 500k”, creating a
      global network of national government driven barcoding programmes,
      informatics and sequencing infrastructure to barcode sequence 500,000
      species. The second phase “<a href="https://ibol.org/programs/bioscan/"
        >BIOSCAN</a
      >” launched in June 2019, and leverages this current network to barcode 2
      million species by 2026. All barcodes generated by UKBOL are uploaded to
      BOLD to help complete the global reference library.

      </h3>

      BIOSCAN is a global initiative spearheaded by the International Barcode of
      Life to take DNA barcoding to a new level and study species as well as
      their interactions. It works by generating DNA barcodes for seven common
      animal, plant, and fungi barcodes at the same time for each specimen
      rather than the more traditional single barcode diagnostic per specimen.
      For example, for a single insect specimen, BIOSCAN barcoding reveals the
      insect species alongside the species of the plants it may have eaten or
      pollinated all in one sequencing reaction.

      </h3>

      The Darwin Tree of Life project aims to sequence the genomes of all
      species of eukaryotic organisms in Britain and Ireland. It is a
      collaboration between biodiversity, genomics and analysis partners that
      hopes to transform the way we do biology, conservation and biotechnology.

      <h3><a href="https://iboleurope.org/">iBOL Europe</a></h3>

      iBOL Europe is part of the International Barcode of Life Consortium (iBOL)
      and its global BIOSCAN initiative which aims to transform understanding of
      species diversity, their interactions, and dynamics. Our aim is to unite
      and connect the national nodes of iBOL as well as the wider community of
      biodiversity researchers present in Europe, and to establish a European
      hub for the International Barcode of Life consortium.

      and other stakeholders to discuss priorities and emerging developments in
      the use of DNA for environmental monitoring.
